### What I learned

While working on this project, I managed to improve my ability to distinquish elements
on the page through class names that are in somewhat nature seen as suitable.

I also learnt to adapt SCSS that I've studied prior to making this project in order to
implement it in the workflow. Furthermore, I realized that I struggled a bit trying
to make this responsive. However, this was in my opinion a way for me to express
my knowledge through different tools such as bootstrap and just regular CSS.

At the end I decided to just keep it simple and not use anyother tools besides
SCSS. Ontop of this, I became better at finding certain details design wise.
